## [Briefly about me:](#briefly-about-me)

Hey! I'm Mikita and I'm 34 y.o.

For ten years of work experience, I have gone through a career path from a CNC setup operator to a chief engineer of a manufacturing enterprise.

I am well versed in the electrical and mechanical design of industrial equipment. I have a good understanding of CNC programming. I am fond of industrial 3D design and work in many CAD systems. I have high communication skills and rich experience in personnel management.

I have always been attracted to the field of web development and now, in my opinion, it's time to find myself in this field. I like to learn something new, work long and hard, set a goal and achieve it. Therefore, I am sure that everything will work out for me and I will become an excellent developer!
